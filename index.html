                <p>I have an extensive background with 25 years of experience in software development including over 13
                    years in a supervision/manager role. I have always been a hands-on manager and continued to
                    participate in code reviews and architecture decisions as well as diving into the code as needed. My
                    background in Microsoft technologies has included everything from Classic ASP, ASP.NET through .NET
                    MVC and MVVM patterns using Knockout.js/Angular.</p>
                <p>My focus has been on developing custom .NET web applications for internal customers with my strengths
                    around analysis and database design. I have been part of Agile teams for over 7 years, participating
                    at all levels from team member (developer) to product owner to Scrum master.</p>

                <h4><strong>Guide Dogs of America</strong></h4>
                <p>My family and I are currently raising our last career change dog, Journey. We raised a total of four
                    puppies.
                    Two have become working guide dogs and two decided they didn&apos;t want the job.
                    Faith was a working guide dog for over nine years and came home to live out her days in the Pacific
                    Northwest with Journey.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h4><strong>Theater Production</strong></h4>
                <p>I have donated my time to various regional theater productions, spending the majority of my over 15
                    years of theater experience with the Westminster Playhouse. I have been involved in all aspects of
                    theater production from being a stagehand, to an Actor (both plays and musicals) to directing two
                    musicals (Pippin, Tommy).</p>
                <br/>
                <h4><strong>Reading</strong></h4>
                <p>I have a "tremendous thirst for knowledge", spending most of my spare time reading computer manuals /
                    programming books or other non-fiction works.</p>
                <br/>
                <h4><strong>Music</strong></h4>
                <p>I have been involved in Music (Arranging, Recording, Performing) since High School. My studio
                    consists of a Presonus Studio One installation including multiple software instruments.</p>
